# VoyageSmart Development Tasks

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Fixed RLS policy for trips table that was causing infinite recursion
  - Issue: The policy was incorrectly comparing `trip_participants.trip_id = trip_participants.id`
  - Fix: Updated to correctly compare `trip_participants.trip_id = trips.id`
- [x] Fixed RLS policy for trip_participants table that was also causing infinite recursion
  - Issue: The policy was incorrectly comparing `trip_participants_1.trip_id = trip_participants_1.trip_id`
  - Fix: Updated to correctly compare `tp.trip_id = trip_participants.trip_id`
- [x] Improved trips fetching in dashboard
  - Issue: Complex query was causing issues with RLS policies
  - Fix: Simplified the approach with better error handling and fallback mechanism
- [x] Fixed logout functionality
