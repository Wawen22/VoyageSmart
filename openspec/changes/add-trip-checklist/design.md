## Context
This document outlines the technical design for the new checklist feature in VoyageSmart.

## Goals
- To provide users with a simple and intuitive way to manage checklists for their trips.
- To ensure the feature is well-integrated with the existing application architecture and design system.

## Decisions
### Database Schema
We will introduce two new tables:

- `checklists`
  - `id` (uuid, primary key)
  - `trip_id` (uuid, foreign key to `trips.id`)
  - `name` (text, e.g., "Personal", "Group")
  - `created_at` (timestampz)
  - `updated_at` (timestampz)

- `checklist_items`
  - `id` (uuid, primary key)
  - `checklist_id` (uuid, foreign key to `checklists.id`)
  - `content` (text)
  - `is_checked` (boolean, default: false)
  - `item_order` (integer)
  - `created_at` (timestampz)
  - `updated_at` (timestampz)

### API Endpoints
We will create the following RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /api/trips/:tripId/checklists`
- `POST /api/checklists/:checklistId/items`
- `PUT /api/checklist-items/:itemId`
- `DELETE /api/checklist-items/:itemId`
- `PUT /api/checklist-items/reorder`

### Frontend
- **Checklist Button:** A new button will be added to the trip page, next to the "Saved Suggestions" button.
- **Checklist Modal:** A new modal component will be created to house the checklist functionality. It will be built using the same components and styles as the "Suggestion Center" modal.
- **State Management:** We will use React's `useState` and `useContext` hooks for managing the checklist state within the modal.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** We will use the `react-beautiful-dnd` library for drag-and-drop functionality, as it is already used in other parts of the application.

## Risks / Trade-offs
- **Performance:** Loading a large number of checklist items could impact performance. We will implement pagination or virtual scrolling if necessary.
- **Real-time updates:** For group checklists, we need to consider how to handle real-time updates from multiple users. We will initially rely on manual refreshing, but may explore using WebSockets in the future.
