## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Review `ExpenseCard` and `ExpenseList` to document current spacing, breakpoints, and action placements that inflate card height on mobile.
- [x] 1.2 Prototype a compact mobile layout (wireframe or notes) covering description, amount, metadata chips, and actions within tighter vertical space.
- [x] 1.3 Update `ExpenseCard` styles/structure to apply the compact layout while keeping desktop presentation polished.
- [x] 1.4 Adjust supporting components/utilities (if needed) to ensure consistent spacing between cards in the list view.

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Manual QA in responsive devtools (≤640px and ≥768px) to confirm readability, tap target sizes, and consistent alignment.
- [x] 2.2 Run existing automated checks (`npm run lint` or targeted tests) to guard against regressions.
