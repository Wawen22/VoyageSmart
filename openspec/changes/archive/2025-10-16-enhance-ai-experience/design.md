# Design: Enhanced AI Experience

This document outlines the architectural and design considerations for enhancing the AI experience in VoyageSmart.

## 1. Proactive Suggestion Service

A new microservice or serverless function will be responsible for generating proactive suggestions. This service will be triggered by various events within the application (e.g., adding a new trip, booking a flight, approaching a travel date).

*   **Event-Driven Architecture**: The service will subscribe to events from a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) or a webhook system.
*   **Suggestion Engine**: The core of the service will be a suggestion engine that uses a combination of rules-based logic and machine learning models to generate relevant and timely suggestions.
*   **Notification Service**: Suggestions will be delivered to the user via a notification service that supports push notifications, in-app messages, and email.

## 2. Interactive AI Component Framework

To move beyond static text responses, we will develop a framework for rendering interactive UI components within the AI chat interface.

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The framework will be based on a library of reusable React components (e.g., maps, calendars, booking forms).
*   **JSON-Based DSL**: The AI will generate a JSON-based domain-specific language (DSL) to describe the UI to be rendered. This DSL will be interpreted by the frontend to render the appropriate components.
*   **Action Handling**: The framework will support handling user interactions with the components (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) and communicating these actions back to the AI.

## 3. Unified User Profile and Preference Center

A centralized user profile and preference center will be created to store all user-related data, including preferences, travel history, and interaction data.

*   **Database Schema**: The database schema will be extended to include new tables for storing detailed user preferences, such as travel style, interests, and budget.
*   **Preference API**: A new API endpoint will be created for managing user preferences.
*   **Data Synchronization**: The user profile will be synchronized with data from other services, such as the AI chat history and trip data.

## 4. Context-Aware AI Middleware

A middleware layer will be introduced to enrich the AI's context with real-time application state.

*   **State Injection**: The middleware will intercept requests to the AI API and inject relevant context, such as the user's current location, upcoming itinerary items, and recent actions.
*   **Session Management**: The middleware will manage the AI session and maintain a consistent context across multiple interactions.
*   **Privacy and Security**: The middleware will be responsible for redacting sensitive information from the context before it is sent to the AI.
