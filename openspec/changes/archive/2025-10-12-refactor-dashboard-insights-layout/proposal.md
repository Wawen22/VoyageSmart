## Why
The separate analytics snapshot card on mobile creates duplicated content and crowds the dashboard, making it harder to scan the "Travel & Analytics Insights" area. Consolidating analytics information inside the insights module and refreshing its visual system will improve clarity and maintain the glassmorphism aesthetic used elsewhere.

## What Changes
- Integrate the mobile analytics snapshot (currently rendered by `SwipeableStats`) into the Travel & Analytics Insights module
- Refresh the Travel & Analytics Insights layout with a sleeker glass-card treatment, responsive spacing, and clearer hierarchy
- Ensure the merged section keeps the modern glassy style system already applied across the dashboard

## Impact
- Improves usability and visual consistency in the mobile dashboard
- No backend or data changes expected
- Requires regression check on dashboard mobile and desktop layouts
