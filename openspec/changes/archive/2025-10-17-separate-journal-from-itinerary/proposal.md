# Proposal: Separate Journal from Itinerary

## Why

Separating the JOURNAL and ITINERARY features will create a more intuitive and focused user experience. Currently, combining them under a single, tabbed interface clutters the itinerary planning process and buries the journal functionality. A dedicated Journal page will elevate its visibility, making it a first-class feature and simplifying the overall navigation and information architecture of the trip planning section.

This proposal outlines the plan to separate the JOURNAL and ITINERARY features into two distinct pages, improving the user experience by providing a dedicated section for each.
