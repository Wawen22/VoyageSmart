/*
 * Enhanced close button styles are now applied directly via Tailwind classes
 * in the component files for better maintainability and to avoid CSS conflicts.

 * Key features implemented via Tailwind:
 * - Glassmorphism effects with backdrop-blur-sm
 * - Hover animations with scale and rotation
 * - Destructive color theme on hover
 * - Touch-friendly sizing
 * - Accessibility features (focus rings, screen reader support)
 * - Mobile optimizations
 *
 * This approach ensures proper positioning and avoids CSS specificity conflicts.
