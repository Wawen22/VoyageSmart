# Export & Reports - Coming Soon Implementation

## Location
- **File**: `src/components/dashboard/AdvancedMetricsModal.tsx`
- **Lines**: 138-191
- **Section**: Travel Analytics & Insights Modal

## What Was Changed

### Before (Original Implementation)
The section contained three functional buttons:
- Export PDF Report
- Download CSV Data
- Share Analytics

### After (Coming Soon Placeholder)
A modern, visually appealing placeholder with:
- ✅ Dashed border card with gradient background

- ✅ Clear description of upcoming features
- ✅ Feature preview pills showing what's coming
- ✅ Fully responsive design
- ✅ Accessible with proper contrast and semantic HTML

## Design Features

### Visual Elements
1. **Dashed Border**: Indicates work-in-progress status
2. **Gradient Background**: Subtle `from-muted/30 via-muted/20 to-background`
3. **Animated Pattern**: Diagonal stripe pattern at 5% opacity
4. **Pulsing Icon**: Large TrendingUp icon with blur glow effect
5. **Coming Soon Badge**: Primary color with animated pulse dot
6. **Feature Pills**: Three preview badges showing upcoming capabilities

### Accessibility
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Semantic HTML structure
- Screen reader friendly
- Keyboard navigation compatible

### Responsiveness
- Mobile-first design
- Flexible layout with proper spacing
- Works across all screen sizes

## How to Re-enable the Feature

When the Export & Reports feature is ready, simply replace lines 138-191 in `AdvancedMetricsModal.tsx` with the original code:

```tsx
{/* Export Options */}
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <TrendingUpIcon className="h-5 w-5" />
      Export & Reports
    </CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row flex-wrap gap-2 sm:gap-3">
      <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="w-full sm:w-auto">
        Export PDF Report
      </Button>
      <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="w-full sm:w-auto">
        Download CSV Data
      </Button>
      <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="w-full sm:w-auto">
        Share Analytics
      </Button>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

Or implement the actual functionality by:
1. Adding event handlers to the buttons
2. Implementing PDF generation logic
3. Implementing CSV export logic
4. Implementing share functionality

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] CSV export includes all relevant data
- [ ] Share functionality works across platforms
- [ ] All buttons are properly styled and responsive
- [ ] Loading states are implemented
