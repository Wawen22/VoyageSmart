# API Documentation

This section provides detailed documentation for VoyageSmart's API endpoints. These endpoints are used by the frontend to communicate with the backend and can also be used by third-party applications.

## ðŸ”„ API Overview

VoyageSmart's API is built using Next.js API routes and communicates with Supabase for data storage and authentication. The API follows RESTful principles and uses JSON for data exchange.

### Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://voyage-smart.vercel.app/api
```

For local development, the base URL is:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

### Authentication

All API endpoints (except for public endpoints) require authentication. Authentication is handled using Supabase Auth and JWT tokens.

For more details, see the [Authentication](./authentication.md) documentation.

### Response Format

All API responses follow a standard format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "error": null
}
```

In case of an error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error message"
  }
}
```

### Error Codes

Common error codes include:

- `UNAUTHORIZED`: User is not authenticated
- `FORBIDDEN`: User does not have permission to access the resource
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Request validation failed
- `SERVER_ERROR`: Internal server error

### Rate Limiting

API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse. The rate limits are:

- 100 requests per minute for authenticated users
- 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated users

### Versioning

The API is currently at version 1. The version is not included in the URL path, but future versions may include it.
