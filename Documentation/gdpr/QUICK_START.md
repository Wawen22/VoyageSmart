## üö® Important Notes

1. **Service Role Key Required:** Account deletion uses `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` which requires the service role key. Make sure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in environment variables.

2. **Cascading Deletes:** Ensure all database tables have proper foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE` to automatically delete related data.

3. **Data Retention:** Financial records (Stripe) are retained for 7 years as required by law, even after account deletion.

4. **Cookie Consent:** The banner appears only once. To test again, clear localStorage or use incognito mode.

5. **Email Verification:** Users must verify their email before full account access (Supabase default).
