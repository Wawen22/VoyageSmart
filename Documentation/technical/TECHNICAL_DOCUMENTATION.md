## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wawen22/VoyageSmart.git
   cd VoyageSmart
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Copy the environment variables example file and update it with your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Edit `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials and other API keys.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## üóÑÔ∏è Supabase Project Details

- Project name: voyage-smart
- Project ID: ijtfwzxwthunsujobvsk
- Region: eu-central-1
- URL: https://ijtfwzxwthunsujobvsk.supabase.co

The database schema has been configured according to the specifications in the README.md file, with all necessary tables, relationships, and security policies.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Optimizations

#### 1. Data Loading Optimizations
- **Parallel API Requests**: Replaced sequential Supabase queries with `Promise.all` for parallel execution in the Itinerary section
- **Data Caching**: Implemented in-memory cache for itinerary, accommodation, and transportation data with 5-minute expiration
- **Session Storage Caching**: Added browser caching via session storage for trip, itinerary, accommodation, transportation, and expense data
- **Optimized Query Patterns**: Replaced multiple queries for daily activities with a single query for all activities, then grouping by day

#### 2. Middleware Optimizations
- **Selective Session Refresh**: Modified middleware to refresh authentication session only when necessary (near expiration or for auth routes)
- **Session Expiration Check**: Added logic to check if a session is near expiration before refreshing it

#### 3. UI/UX Loading Improvements
- **Skeleton Loaders**: Added detailed skeleton loaders for Itinerary, Accommodations, Transportation, and Expenses sections
- **Advanced Animations**: Implemented smooth animations for page transitions and user interactions
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading for heavy components like modals and calendar view
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Added React Suspense boundaries around lazy-loaded components
- **Component Memoization**: Implemented memoization for components like AccommodationCard, TransportationCard, and ExpenseCard
- **Visual Feedback**: Added animation effects to provide visual feedback during user interactions

### Future Optimization Recommendations

#### 1. Code Splitting
- Implement route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- Use dynamic imports for large libraries like `react-big-calendar`

#### 2. Image Optimization
- Implement responsive images with srcset for different device sizes
- Use Next.js Image component with appropriate size and quality settings
- Consider implementing lazy loading for below-the-fold images

#### 3. State Management Optimization
- Review Redux store structure to minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations using `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Consider using Redux Toolkit's `createEntityAdapter` for normalized state

#### 4. Database Query Optimization
- Add appropriate indexes to frequently queried fields in Supabase
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use RLS policies efficiently to minimize unnecessary data transfer

#### 5. Network Optimization
- Implement HTTP/2 for multiplexed connections
- Add appropriate cache headers for static assets
- Consider implementing a service worker for offline functionality and caching

#### 6. Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement performance monitoring with tools like Sentry or New Relic
- Add user timing API markers for critical rendering paths
- Set up Real User Monitoring (RUM) to track actual user experience

## üß™ Performance Testing

To verify the effectiveness of these optimizations, consider implementing:

1. **Lighthouse Tests**: Run regular Lighthouse audits to track performance scores
2. **Web Vitals Monitoring**: Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in production
3. **Load Testing**: Use tools like k6 or Artillery to simulate high traffic scenarios

## üîÆ Next Steps

### 1. Mobile App Setup
- Initialize React Native with Expo
- Configure shared code structure between web and mobile
- Implement responsive UI components

### 2. Advanced Features
- Implement route planning with Mapbox
- Add real-time updates for shared content
- Implement advanced search and filtering
- Add analytics and reporting features
