- **Itinerary Generation Wizard**: Automated activity generation based on user preferences
- **Trip Context Integration**: AI has access to complete trip information for relevant responses
- **Subscription-based Access**: AI features are available only to users with AI Assistant subscription

## üó£Ô∏è AI Travel Assistant

### Features
- **Context-aware responses** based on current trip information
- **Trip-specific information** including accommodations, transportation, and itinerary
- **Natural language processing** for understanding user queries
- **Formatted responses** with proper structure and readability
- **Real-time trip data integration**

### Implementation Details

#### System Prompt
The AI assistant uses a comprehensive system prompt that includes:
- Role definition as a travel assistant
- Trip context (name, dates, participants)
- Accommodation details
- Transportation information
- Itinerary activities
- Response formatting guidelines

#### Context Integration
```typescript
// Trip context is dynamically built and includes:
- Trip basic information (name, dates, participants)
- Accommodations with locations and dates
- Transportation with routes and times
- Itinerary activities organized by day
- Expense information (if relevant)
```

#### Response Formatting

- Concise initial responses with essential information

### Usage
1. Users click the "Assistente AI" button in any trip section
2. AI modal opens with trip context pre-loaded
3. Users can ask questions about their trip
4. AI provides contextual responses based on trip data

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è AI Itinerary Generation Wizard

### Features
- **Step-by-step wizard interface** for collecting user preferences
- **Date selection** with visual day buttons
- **Trip theme integration** for context-aware generation
- **Specific user requests** handling (e.g., "breakfast at 9 AM")
- **Time constraint respect** (e.g., "before 16:00")
- **Location-specific suggestions** based on trip destinations
- **Pre-save editing capabilities**
- **Batch activity generation**

### Wizard Flow
1. **Welcome Screen**: Introduction and start button
2. **Date Selection**: Choose specific days for activity generation
3. **Preferences Collection**: Gather user preferences and specific requests
4. **Activity Generation**: AI generates activities based on inputs
5. **Review & Edit**: Users can review and modify generated activities
6. **Save to Itinerary**: Activities are added to the trip itinerary

### Implementation Details

#### Activity Generation Process
```typescript
// The wizard collects:
- Selected dates for activity generation
- User preferences and specific requests
- Trip theme and context
- Time constraints and preferences
- Location preferences within the trip area
```

#### AI Prompt Structure
The wizard uses specialized prompts that include:
- Trip context and theme
- Selected dates and existing activities
- User-specific requests and preferences
- Time and location constraints
- Output format specifications for structured data

#### Generated Activity Format
```json
{
  "day": "2024-01-15",
  "time": "09:00",
  "title": "Activity Title",
  "description": "Detailed activity description",
  "location": "Specific location",
  "duration": "2 hours",
  "category": "food" | "culture" | "nature" | "entertainment"
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### API Integration
- **Google Gemini AI**: Using 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp' model
- **API Key**: Configured via environment variables
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures

### Backend Implementation
```typescript
// API endpoint: /api/ai/chat
- Handles both assistant chat and wizard requests
- Validates user subscription status
- Builds context from trip data
- Formats responses appropriately
```

### Frontend Components
- **AIAssistant**: Main chatbot component
- **AIWizard**: Itinerary generation wizard
- **Subscription checks**: Ensures only authorized users access AI features
- **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during AI processing

### Security Considerations
- **Subscription validation**: Server-side checks for AI plan access
- **Input sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents excessive API usage
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Subscription Requirements
- AI features require an active "AI Assistant" subscription plan
- Subscription status is checked on both frontend and backend
- Users without subscription see upgrade prompts

### Model Configuration
- **Model**: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **Max Tokens**: Configured based on use case
- **Safety Settings**: Configured to block harmful content

## üìñ Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Provide clear context** in user queries
2. **Use specific requests** in the wizard for better results
3. **Review generated activities** before saving
4. **Combine AI suggestions** with manual planning for best results

### Limitations
- AI responses are based on available trip data
- Generated activities may need manual adjustment
- Time constraints may not always be perfectly respected
- Location suggestions are based on general knowledge, not real-time data

### Tips for Better Results
