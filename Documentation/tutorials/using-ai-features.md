## 4. Advanced AI Assistant Features

The AI Assistant offers several advanced features to enhance your travel planning experience.

### Asking for Recommendations

You can ask the AI Assistant for personalized recommendations:

```
You: Can you recommend some family-friendly activities in Paris?

AI Assistant: Based on your trip with 2 adults and 2 children (ages 8 and 10), here are some family-friendly activities in Paris:

1. **Disneyland Paris** - A magical experience for the whole family, located just outside the city.

2. **Jardin d'Acclimatation** - An amusement park and garden with rides, games, and animals.

3. **Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie** - An interactive science museum with exhibits designed for children.

4. **Luxembourg Gardens** - A beautiful park with a playground, puppet shows, and toy sailboats.

5. **Paris Zoological Park** - A modern zoo with immersive habitats and over 2,000 animals.

Would you like me to add any of these to your itinerary?
```

### Getting Local Information

You can ask about local customs, transportation, and practical information:

```
You: What's the best way to get around Paris?

AI Assistant: Based on your accommodations in the 4th arrondissement and your planned activities, here are the best transportation options in Paris:

1. **Metro** - Paris has an extensive metro system that's fast and efficient. The closest stations to your accommodation are Hôtel de Ville and Châtelet.

2. **Bus** - Buses offer a more scenic route and are good for shorter distances.

3. **Walking** - Many of your planned activities are within walking distance of each other in the city center.

4. **Vélib'** - Paris's bike-sharing system is a great way to explore the city.

I notice you have activities in both the city center and outlying areas like Versailles. For Versailles, I recommend taking the RER C train from central Paris.

Would you like information about transportation passes that might save you money during your stay?
```

### Analyzing Your Itinerary

You can ask the AI Assistant to analyze your itinerary for potential issues:

```
You: Is my itinerary for June 3rd realistic?

AI Assistant: Looking at your itinerary for June 3rd, I notice a few potential issues:

1. You have planned to visit the Louvre from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. The Louvre is quite large, and most visitors spend at least 3-4 hours there. You might feel rushed with only 2 hours.

2. There's only 30 minutes between your Louvre visit and your lunch reservation at Café Marly, which is cutting it close if the Louvre is crowded.

3. Your afternoon includes both Montmartre and the Eiffel Tower, which are on opposite sides of the city. Travel time between these locations is approximately 45 minutes by metro.

Would you like me to suggest some adjustments to make your day more manageable?
```

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: The AI Assistant isn't responding.
**Solution**: Refresh the page and try again. If the issue persists, check your internet connection.

**Issue**: The generated activities don't match my preferences.
**Solution**: Try being more specific with your preferences. For example, instead of "I like food," try "I'm interested in authentic French cuisine, especially pastries and cheese."

**Issue**: The map isn't showing all my activities.
**Solution**: Make sure all activities have valid coordinates. You can edit an activity's location by clicking on it and selecting "Edit Location."

**Issue**: The AI Assistant doesn't seem to have access to my updated itinerary.
**Solution**: The AI Assistant may take a moment to refresh its context. Try asking a different question and then returning to your original query.
